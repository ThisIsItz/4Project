# Travel APP

This is the last project in Front-end Udacity Nanodegree.

The objective of this project is to build a travel application that uses the information incoming from the user (location and date) to show him some information about the trip.

The app shows the following information:
- A photo of the city.
- The weather in that city.
- How many days is your trip away.
- How many days is going to take the trip.
