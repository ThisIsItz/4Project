# Travel APP

This is the last project in Front-end Udacity Nanodegree.

The objective in this project is to build a travel application that uses the information incoming from the user (location and date) to show him some information about the trip. For this project I've used three APIs (Geonames, DarkSkys and Pixabay).

## How to start


`cd` into your new folder and run:
- ```npm install```
- ```npm start``` to start the server
- ````npm run build-dev``` to star the app
